hello everyone,

i will be explaining about Azure Management Services,

so here are the management tools which are used mostly.

there are other management tools as well like, user privacy, solutions,resource graphs,policy.

but will be explaining these 4 main tools.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
lets start with, Log analytics.

Log analytics is a workspace where the data collected by Azure monitor is stored. 
you can dump all logs wrt whats happening with the azure resource into workspace.

will show you how to create the workspace and store the logs. 

once the ws is created will have to connect the data source, that could be VM or creating an activity log.

here i am selecting a VM and adding a few event logs such as application, operations, system log.

then go logs and write a query for Performance/events using a query lang KQL (Kusto query language)

Next tool is Cost Management and Billing,

With Azure products and services, you only pay for what you use. As you create and use Azure resources, you are charged for the resources. 
You use Azure Cost Management and Billing features to conduct billing tasks and manage billing access to costs.
Azure Billing features are used to review your invoiced costs and manage access to billing information.

A billing account is created when you sign up to use Azure. You use your billing account to manage your invoices, payments, and track costs. 
You can have access to multiple billing accounts. For example, you might have signed up for Azure for your personal projects. 
So, you might have an individual Azure subscription with a billing account. You could also have access through your organization's Enterprise Agreement 
or Microsoft Customer Agreement. For each scenario you would have a separate billing account.

Next tool is Automation Account

when we have more num of resources its difficult to manage.

like ex : we have some resources created and we have to manually deploy them, its ok if there are a few resources/services but when we have huge no.of services
to deploy we can go for automation, we can relace the tasks which we do manully and automate them.

Runbook automation. Runbook automation (RBA) is the ability to define, build, orchestrate, manage, and report on 
workflows that support system and network operational processes.

Azure Automation allows you to create and manage PowerShell, PowerShell Workflow, and graphical runbooks. 
Automation executes your runbooks based on the logic defined inside them.

Enter the account information, including the selected account name. For Create Azure Run As account, 
choose Yes so that the artifacts to simplify authentication to Azure are enabled automatically.
 When the information is complete, click Create to start the Automation account deployment.

Select Automation Accounts and then choose the Automation account you've created.

Click Runbooks under Process Automation. The list of runbooks is displayed. By default, several tutorial runbooks are enabled in the account.

In this quickstart, youâ€™ve deployed an Automation account, started a runbook job, and viewed the job results. 
To learn more about Azure Automation, continue to the quickstart for creating your first runbook.

last tool is Metrics

we have an app running on the machine and it is memory intensive and we want to see how much memory is still available, we can do that by custom metric.

Analyze
Use metrics explorer to analyze collected metrics on a chart and compare metrics from different resources.

Visualize
Pin a chart from metrics explorer to an Azure dashboard.

Alert
Configure a metric alert rule that sends a notification or takes automated action when the metric value crosses a threshold.
